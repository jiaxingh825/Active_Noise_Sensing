# MRI denoising using Active Noise Sensing and Convoluional neural network
This repo contains scripts and sample results (to be uplodaded) since data files are too large to be uploaded.
## Active Noise Sensing (ANS)
Using external EMI sensing coils to collect noise only signal. The model is trained on the noise only signal and the noise map in the MRI headcoil channels. Trained at K-space
## Single image Super Resolution (SISR)
Single Image in - single image out super resolution model. Trained on image space at the moment
